add a rough description of what the script does to any script we have, even if its there already. Use """..."""

add this to any script we start from scratch:

import os
import sys
from dotenv import load_dotenv


# Add the parent directory to the system path to allow importing modules from it
sys.path.append(os.path.abspath(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..')))
import _00_utils
_00_utils.setup_project_directory()

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

---------------------------

Dont use prints,  use logging. We love using icons in logging: üîÑ ‚úÖ ‚ùå - change any scripts that dont have that implemented yet.
We generally dont use a "if name = main" protection - unless it is needed for the script to work properly.
Any script must have a summary of what it does - keep up to date and add to scripts that dont have one.
I want important parameters to be added to the script as constants.
I want you to explain any changes to the code with detailed comments in the code.

---------------------------

Also, just so you are aware of the full context, we are building this:

system-specification.md
