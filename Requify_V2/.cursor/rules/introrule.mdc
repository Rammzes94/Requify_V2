Be very proactive, but if you changed something that you werent directly prompted, explain the reason behind it.
Proactively keep trying until the thing you were prompted to do works. 
Use the "temp" folder to store scripts that are likely just temporary.

Generally try not to bloat, keep the code lean.

Ensure to dive deep into our codebase for anything non-trivial, I want you to really find root causes of bugs.

add a rough description of what the script does to any script we have, even if its there already. Use """..."""

add this to any script we start from scratch:
from src.utils import setup_logging, get_logger, update_token_counters, get_token_usage, print_token_usage, reset_token_counters, setup_project_directory, generate_timestamp


---------------------------

Dont use prints,  use logging. We love using icons in logging: üîÑ ‚úÖ ‚ùå - change any scripts that dont have that implemented yet.
We generally dont use a "if name = main" protection - unless it is needed for the script to work properly.
Any script must have a summary of what it does - keep up to date and add to scripts that dont have one.
I want important parameters to be added to the script as constants.
I want you to explain any changes to the code with detailed comments in the code.

-------------------------
TESTING:

follow Dave Farley‚Äôs recommendations regarding how to write tests, and in particular, unit tests. Essentially, you should make sure the tests test some sort of outcome or functionality, NOT any particular implementation.

Also, just so you are aware of the full context, we are building this:
