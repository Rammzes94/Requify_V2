Image Description:

The image is a highly detailed technical diagram illustrating the Fighter Jet Rocket Launcher System, specifically the RLX-5000 model. It is shown mounted on the underside of a fighter jetâ€™s wing. The launcher is cylindrical, sleek, and streamlined for aerodynamic efficiency, colored in matte gray to reduce radar cross-section.

Key technical components highlighted include:

- **Launcher Tube Assembly:** Showing seven separate tubes arranged in a compact circular configuration, each with individual launch doors sealed till ignition.
- **Mounting Bracket:** A robust, vibration-damping mechanism that attaches the launcher system firmly to the fighter jet wing pylons.
- **Guidance Sensors:** Small laser and infrared sensor pods mounted near the front with sightlines extending outward to depict laser, infrared, and GPS guidance capability.
